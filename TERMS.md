# Terms of Service

By using the TinyTimer Discord bot (the "Bot"), you agree to the following terms:

1. **Service Description**  
   The Bot updates user nicknames in Discord servers to include their username, country code, and local time, based on input provided by the user or server admin.

2. **No Guarantees**  
   The Bot is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. We make no guarantees of uptime, performance, or availability.

3. **User Conduct**  
   Users must not abuse, spam, or attempt to interfere with the operation of the Bot. Malicious use or attempts to break functionality are prohibited.

4. **Data Usage**  
   The Bot temporarily processes usernames, timezone input, and country codes solely for formatting nicknames. No personal data is stored or shared.

5. **Modifications**  
   We reserve the right to update or remove the Bot or change these Terms at any time, without prior notice.

6. **Disclaimer**  
   This Bot is not affiliated with or endorsed by Discord. Use of the Bot also falls under Discordâ€™s [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy).

7. **Minimum Age Requirement**  
   Use of the Bot is restricted to users who meet the minimum age required by Discord's Terms of Service in their country of residence. Typically, this is 13 years old, but may be higher depending on local laws (e.g. 16 in parts of the EU).

   By using the Bot, you confirm that you meet this age requirement.

**If you do not agree with these terms, do not use the Bot.**
