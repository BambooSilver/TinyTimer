## What Data We Process

The bot processes the following information **temporarily and only during command use**:

- Discord username
- Country code (provided by the user or admin)
- Timezone (either inferred or user-provided)

This information is only used to format a nickname like:
{username} | {CountryCode} {LocalTime}

## Data Storage

- **No personal data is stored.**
- The bot does not log or save user data to any database or external service.
- All processing happens in memory and is discarded after the operation.

---

## Data Sharing

- We do **not** share any information with third parties.
- The bot runs on Discord, so interactions are subject to Discord’s own [Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy).

## GDPR Rights

Although no personal data is stored, if you have any concerns or questions about how the bot works, feel free to contact the developer.

You have the right to request information about your data, but since we don’t store any, there’s generally nothing to retrieve or delete.
